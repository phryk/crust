== Short description ==

Crust supplies you with a minimal shell-substitute to host via sshd as an
interface for some automation tasks.

A daemon for some cooler stuff might come along at some point, too.

A lot of automation solutions seem to do this sort of stuff by just giving
automation tools access to a full shell, or at best a shell that white- or
blacklists the executables the shell is allowed to use.

This seems like a bad ideaâ„¢.

As far as I understand, this still means that the shell with a maybe
turing-complete command set as well as all callable executables can
expose their own flaws.

Crust tries to mitigate this by just supplying a minimal pseudo-shell
that offers it's own commands instead of letting users directly call
system executables.


=== Using this shit ===

Currently, there's very little code, none that does anything representing
any real use-case and there's not installation procedure.

To try the pseudoshell append this repositories' root directory to you
PYTHONPATH environment-variable and call the 'bin/crust' script.
